    <h2>2. Access to Database Metadata</h2>
    <p>
      Priori DB allows users to connect to databases, execute queries and manage
      data base infraestructure . During this process, the application will
      retrieve metadata from the connected database (e.g., table structures,
      schema information) to display relevant details and assist with database
      management tasks. Priori DB does not transmit this data externally.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Local Processing: This metadata is processed locally on your device and
        is never sent to any third-party servers or servers associated with
        Priori DB.
      </li>
      <li>
        Network Communication: All network communication occurs exclusively
        between your device and the database you are connected to. Priori DB
        will not send any data to third-party servers.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3. Internet Connectivity</h2>
    <p>
      Priori DB operates as an offline application and does not require internet
      connectivity for its functionality.

        the internet for updates, documentation access, or any other online
        services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>User-Initiated Connections:</strong> The only network
        interactions occur when you, the user, connect to an external database.
        These connections are entirely under your control.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>Priori DB does not share any user information with third parties.</p>
    <ul>

        <strong>Direct Database Interaction:</strong> All database interactions
        occur directly between your device and the configured database. Priori
        DB does not interfere with or access this data beyond what is necessary
        to provide its functionality.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Third-Party Involvement:</strong> No data is transmitted to
        servers associated with Priori DB or any external parties.
      </li>
    </ul>

      device, such as access to local files or network connections.

        solely to enable the application's functionality, such as connecting to
        databases, storing connections configurations, user settings, and saving
        interaction history locally.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No External Data Collection: </strong> The application does not
        use these permissions to collect, store, or transmit any data
        externally.
      </li>
    </ul>
